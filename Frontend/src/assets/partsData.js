Mostly marketed in North America, it still fell under the flagship luxury brand of Cadillac. Buick’s are also known for exceptional quality, and reliability. Don’t worry too much if you end up needing to purchase parts for a Buick. Most GM models interchange, because it’s cheaper to make cars that all use the same parts, just different ‘skins’. We have taken inventory of all of our junkyards that have any Buick related vehicles in their inventory, and have made sure we were able to check on each and every used Buick part we could locate for our customers. Popularity has also given the salvage yard industry plenty of inventory to go around. Buick was one of the few GM brands to survive the ‘down size’ of 2008.",
